// * Create: A screen to add new events with a title, description, and image.
// * Update: Ability to update event details.
// * Delete: Ability to delete an event.
// * View: A screen to display all the created events in a list.
//

// * Firebase Firestore for storing event data (title, description, and image URL).
// * Firebase Storage for storing event images.
// 2. GetX State Management:

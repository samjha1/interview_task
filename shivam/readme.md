Step-by-Step Implementation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Flutter Project
Open a terminal and create a new Flutter project.
Navigate to the project directory.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Required Dependencies
Add Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and GetX in pubspec.yaml.
Run flutter pub get to install the dependencies.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Firebase in the Project
Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
Register the Flutter app and download the google-services.json (for Android).
Add the required configurations in the android/app/build.gradle and android/build.gradle files.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Firebase in Flutter
Modify the main.dart file to initialize Firebase before running the app.
void main() async {
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Authentication using Firebase Authentication
Create an AuthController using GetX for handling authentication.
Implement Sign Up and Login functionalities.
Store user session state and navigate accordingly.
use email and password from the firebase Authentication


6Ô∏è‚É£ Create Authentication Screens
Signup Screen: Takes email and password input from users and registers them using Firebase Authentication.
Login Screen: Allows users to log in using registered credentials.
Home Screen: Redirects authenticated users to the event management screen.


7Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Firestore for Event Management
Create an EventController using GetX for handling event operations.
Implement Firestore queries for Create, Read, and Delete operations.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Design Event Management Screens
Event List Screen: Displays all the stored events.
Add Event Screen: Allows users to add new events.
Edit Event Screen: Allows users to modify existing events.
8Ô∏è‚É£title and content of the events. these values are stored in firebase database store.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Navigation using GetX
Use Get.to() for screen navigation instead of Navigator.push().
Ensure smooth transitions between authentication and event management screens.

üîü Test the App
Run the app using flutter run and test authentication and event management functionalities.
